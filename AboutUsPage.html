            Welcome to Women in IT or WIT! WIT is a sub-association under the
            Business and IT Student Society (BITSoc) at Ontario Tech University that is
            open to all, with the main focus of empowering and connecting women
            currently in or entering the IT field. WIT aims to create an inclusive space
            where everyone feels welcome while ensuring that equality exists in the IT
            field across all genders. Women in IT started in 2018 with a small team of 6
            executives. To this date they have grown as a club
            and executive team. This online store is a way to sell to the general
            public, as a way to raise funds for a scholarship for females coming into IT.
